            The best practices for form design outlined in the article tie in to what I was taught in DES 112 – Principles of UI/UX. The same guidelines for other digital media – websites, apps, etc – that we were taught in that course (and in DES 117) seem to guide the creation of a good form.

            Throughout the article, author Salim Ansari asserts and reasserts the concepts of cognitive load and interaction costs, the two driving forces behind conscious form design choices. Many of the tips outlined pay close attention to both of these. For instance, Ansari warns against drop-downs whenever possible, both because they hurl information at the user in one large chunk and because they lengthen interaction time unnecessarily. Other examples (label positioning, easy questions first, etc.) are explained similarly. These concepts, taught in previous courses, act as the foundation on which tasks such as form design are built. In understanding these, form design should theoretically come naturally to me.

            <b>Best Practice:</b> Tinder’s account creation exemplifies best practices by breaking each field  into its own page to reduce cognitive load. Additionally, it approaches the user in a friendly textual manner, building trust with them as they venture into the dating world. (<a href="https://tinder.com/">https://tinder.com/</a>)
