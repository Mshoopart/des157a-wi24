        <h2>Studio 2 - Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <h3>What I learned & Project Inspiration</h3>
        <time  datetime="2024-02-07">February 7 2024</time>

        <p>“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading...” reminded me to slow down in my visual analyses, to stay curious, and to experiment with hypotheses and discussion. As the author, Michael Gonchar, states, “young people often want to hurry up and make meaning via a quick skim,” when this is not necessarily best.</p>

        <p>Throughout the article, the reader is shown a number of “What’s Going On in This Picture?” pieces, heavily discussed as interesting, thought-provoking compositions. While they serve as proof that careful visual interpretation is important to cognitive operation, they also hint at the fact that subject material must be unique enough to inspire conversation. When taking a look at Studio 2, I aspire to achieve the same level of mystery that the Times’ pictures serve its readers. After all, I want to encourage the user to investigate my narrative, rather than passively scroll or click through. In the same way that “What’s Going On in This picture” dissects individual components of photographs, I would like to use one primary image in my project and allow users to click through different parts of it.</p>

        <p>The website <a href="https://abstract-intelligence.com/">Abstract Intelligence</a> acts as a great example of interactivity and thought on the web. While it doesn’t necessarily align with the style I’m going for, it is definitely a work of art in itself. The element I most like about this example is the effect of the cursor on imagery. Fitting in with the site’s focus on advancements in technology, cursor-image interactions create a shifting, pixelated, glitch effect. Since I’m interested in a video game theme for my project, something like this could be fun (but is probably difficult to achieve).</p>

        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <h3>Another Review of Best Practices</h3>
        <time  datetime="2024-01-31">January 31 2024</time>

        <p>The article “Overuse of Overlays,” by Kathryn Whitenton, encouraged me to carefully consider cognitive load and accessibility in overlays. The opening of the article delves into a case study in which Apple created an overlay so large it required a massive scroll bar and anchor tags. Without even approaching the logistics of overlays, this example made clear the importance of efficiency when considering them.</p>

        <p>Continuing on with this point, Whitenton makes a compelling argument against overlays more than she does for them. This isn’t to say that they are bad practice, rather that there must be good reason for them or else they make content inaccessible/trickier to navigate. If content can exist without an overlay, then it is probably best we don’t add one. A few circumstances in which overlays may be necessary are made clear: confirming a serious action, etc. But as a whole, it seems overlays are easily misconstrued (and should be avoided). When considering an overlay, debugging and accessibility should be top priorities, or else they may detract from the user’s overall experience. Taking another look at Apple’s case, we may also consider sorting overlay content into its own page if it makes sense on its own. </p>

        <h2>Researching Form Design</h2>
        <h3>A Review of Best Practices</h3>
        <time  datetime="2024-01-24">January 24 2024</time>

        <p>
            The best practices for form design outlined in the article tie in to what I was taught in DES 112 – Principles of UI/UX. The same guidelines for other digital media – websites, apps, etc – that we were taught in that course (and in DES 117) seem to guide the creation of a good form.

        <p>
            Throughout the article, author Salim Ansari asserts and reasserts the concepts of cognitive load and interaction costs, the two driving forces behind conscious form design choices. Many of the tips outlined pay close attention to both of these. For instance, Ansari warns against drop-downs whenever possible, both because they hurl information at the user in one large chunk and because they lengthen interaction time unnecessarily. Other examples (label positioning, easy questions first, etc.) are explained similarly. These concepts, taught in previous courses, act as the foundation on which tasks such as form design are built. In understanding these, form design should theoretically come naturally to me.

            <b>Best Practice:</b> Tinder’s account creation exemplifies best practices by breaking each field  into its own page to reduce cognitive load. Additionally, it approaches the user in a friendly textual manner, building trust with them as they venture into the dating world. (<a href="https://tinder.com/">https://tinder.com/</a>)
