        <h2>Researching Form Design</h2>
        <h3>A Review of Best Practices</h3>
        <time  datetime="2024-01-24">January 24 2024</time>

        <p>
            The best practices for form design outlined in the article tie in to what I was taught in DES 112 – Principles of UI/UX. The same guidelines for other digital media – websites, apps, etc – that we were taught in that course (and in DES 117) seem to guide the creation of a good form.

            Throughout the article, author Salim Ansari asserts and reasserts the concepts of cognitive load and interaction costs, the two driving forces behind conscious form design choices. Many of the tips outlined pay close attention to both of these. For instance, Ansari warns against drop-downs whenever possible, both because they hurl information at the user in one large chunk and because they lengthen interaction time unnecessarily. Other examples (label positioning, easy questions first, etc.) are explained similarly. These concepts, taught in previous courses, act as the foundation on which tasks such as form design are built. In understanding these, form design should theoretically come naturally to me.

            <b>Best Practice:</b> Tinder’s account creation exemplifies best practices by breaking each field  into its own page to reduce cognitive load. Additionally, it approaches the user in a friendly textual manner, building trust with them as they venture into the dating world. (<a href="https://tinder.com/">https://tinder.com/</a>)

        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <h3>Another Review of Best Practices</h3>
        <time  datetime="2024-01-31">January 31 2024</time>

        <p>The article “Overuse of Overlays,” by Kathryn Whitenton, encouraged me to carefully consider cognitive load and accessibility in overlays. The opening of the article delves into a case study in which Apple created an overlay so large it required a massive scroll bar and anchor tags. Without even approaching the logistics of overlays, this example made clear the importance of efficiency when considering them.</p>

        <p>Continuing on with this point, Whitenton makes a compelling argument against overlays more than she does for them. This isn’t to say that they are bad practice, rather that there must be good reason for them or else they make content inaccessible/trickier to navigate. If content can exist without an overlay, then it is probably best we don’t add one. A few circumstances in which overlays may be necessary are made clear: confirming a serious action, etc. But as a whole, it seems overlays are easily misconstrued (and should be avoided). When considering an overlay, debugging and accessibility should be top priorities, or else they may detract from the user’s overall experience. Taking another look at Apple’s case, we may also consider sorting overlay content into its own page if it makes sense on its own. </p>
