    <h1>Expert Review and Report</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The first expert I met with for critique was Rheiana, our undergrad design tutor. As a tutor, Rheiana has extensive knowledge of the DES 157A course curriculum and personal experience with its studio projects. She is also deeply involved in the UC Davis design community as a member of Design Interactive, etc.</p>

            <p>The second expert I met with was Andrei Dominiq, otherwise known as James Junk, an up and coming graphic designer who creates for both his own brand and Impact magazine. As a graphic designer, Andrei has extensive professional experience with visual composition and foundational design principles.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Both experts believed my graphics are adequate, but had a few comments on the design of the characters and UI. Rheiana was confused about the health bars, suggesting that I add percentages to show the amount of hit points left for each character. Additionally, she and Andrei both asked for a victory overlay that would add more to the “[CHARACTER] WINS” text. Andrei also suggested I show both characters’ movesets or powers, which I am planning on adding once I create necessary animations. In general, they wanted me to expand the universe beyond just the skyline.</p>
