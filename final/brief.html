    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <article>
        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>For my final project, I plan to update Studio 3 because it revolves around my passion for gaming and has in general been my favorite of the three studios thus far.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>I plan to focus primarily on the visual design aspect of this project so that I can get it to emulate Street Fighter as much as possible. Given that the real game offers character and stage selection, I'd like to add at least one of the two to my composition to keep things fresh as users continue to play. Stage selection is likely what I will stick with because I can simply randomize backgrounds, rather than having users manually choose them (easier to code).</p> 
            
        <p>To add more life to the game, I'd like to add some kind of animation to my characters and backgrounds, too. I will do this by creating several picture frames that display movement and have the script run through them as they are triggered, or as time passes by. This stretches over into functionality, which will be my second focus.</p>
        
        <p>Usability is relatively self-explanatory already, as there are only a select few buttons for users to choose from and they are clearly distinguished. I am still interested in usability testing, however, to ensure that what I have is adequate.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>

        <p>I have some connections to concept artists within the film and games industries, which I can use for visual design feedback. Since character designs are an important part of this project, I would like to reach out to some of the character artists I follow on Artstation. I plan on cold messaging a selection of artists to see if I can get a response from any. There is actually a games studio back in my hometown, too, which I have already reached out to about possible work opportunities. I can follow up with questions about this project.</p>
